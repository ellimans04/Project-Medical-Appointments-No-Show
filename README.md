# Project-Medical-Appointments-No-Show
## Introduction ##
The Project:Medical Appointment No Shows, relied on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments?resource=download) collected from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient were included in each row. We need to investigate this dataset to find out what are factors associated with patients' attendance or failed attendance to the scheduled appointment.
### Questions ###
The project focused on specific questions to guide the investigator to review important factors which may contribute to patientsâ€™ attendance or failed attendance to a scheduled appointment and the following questions were raised:
1. How is gender associated with show-up or no show-up for an appointment?
2. How is age associated with show-up or no show-up?
3. Does any one of the chronic conditions or other ailments associated with the outcomes?
4. Does the use of SMS alerts improve the outcome?

These will help produce a report with the following deliverables: 
1.	A clear summary of the findings
2.	A description of all data sources used and limitation there of.
3.	Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data 
4.	Supporting visualizations  
5.	Top high-level content recommendations based on the analysis
